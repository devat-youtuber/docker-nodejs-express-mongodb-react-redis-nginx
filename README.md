  5. mkdir command  
  mkdir Linux is one of the basic Linux commands in the environment. As the name suggests, this command is used to make a directory or in other words, it used to create a directory. The following command will create a new folder called a test folder. An example of the mkdir command:  

    mkdir testfolder           

  6. chmod command  
  The chmod command is used to set the file permission or a flag on a folder or a file. The flags describe who can read, write into the file or a folder. This is one of the most crucial commands of the Linux environment. It is widely used by administrators. For example,  

    chmod -R 7 test.txt            

  7. rmdir command

  13. curl command  
  The curl command is used to extract information from Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) or IP addresses. If it is not installed in your Linux environment then, first of all, you have to use apt-get command to install curl package.  

    curl https://github.com/torvalds/linux         

  14. echo command  
  The echo command is used to print the specified text on the terminal window. For example, if you want to print ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù text on the terminal window then this command can be used.   
 
    echo Hello World        

  15. free command  
  The free command is used to generate information about memory usage. It calculates for both the main Random Access Memory (RAM) and swap memory. For example

  ZIP is a confining and file packaging service for Linux. Each file is saved in a separate .zip file with the extension .zip. zip is used to shrink the files to decrease file size and also utilized as a file package utility. zip is free in various operating systems like Unix, Linux, Windows, etc. The program is beneficial for packaging a collection of files for sharing; for archiving files; and for maintaining disk location by provisionally reducing additional files or folders.  

    $zip newfile.zip name.txt                

  23. dd  
  dd is a command-line service for Linux operating systems whose main goal is to change and copy files. This is one of the most important commands. dd can also be utilized for chores such as backing up the boot area and getting a thickened mass of temporary data. It can also perform transformations on the data as it is depicted, like byte order exchanging and change to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC.  

    dd if = /dev/hda of = ~/hdadisk.img            

  The above command is used to create an image of a Hard Disk. The dd command can also be used to create CDROM Backup and to restore the Hard Disk image.  

  24. chown  
  The chown command enables users to modify the user and/or group control of an assigned file, directory, or representative link. In Linux, all files are connected with an owner and a collection and distributed with support access preferences for the file owner, the segments, and others. In Linux, each userhas some characteristics affiliated with them. These characteristics include a user ID and a home directory. Users can add more users into a unit or a group to make the method of controlling users more straightforwardly. In this, a stipulated user can be connected with a ‚Äúdefault group‚Äù. It can also be a segment of other groups on the machine. In Linux, regular users can modify the group of the file only if they hold the file rights and solely to a group of which they are a branch. Managing users can modify the group control of all files.  

    sudo chown root myfile1.txt          

  25. sudo  
  The sudo command lets users operate applications as a different user, by default the root. If the user uses a lot of time on the prompt then the sudo is one of the commands that users will utilize pretty often. This is the most important command. sudo is actually a ‚ÄúSuper User DO‚Äù command in Linux. It is usually applied as a prefix of any command that the only superuser is permitted to execute. If someone prefixes ‚Äúsudo‚Äù with any Linux command then that command runs with heightened rights or in other words provides a user with precise authorizations to perform a command as superuser.  

    sudo apt-get update             

  26. cal  
  Cal command is one of the most widely used Linux commands. Users can fire the cal command from the Linux terminal window to view the time.
